# OpenRig website

The website and user documentation of [OpenRig](https://github.com/Siryu6/OpenRig), the open
source guitar pedalboard. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and
[Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # http://localhost:4321
npm run build     # static site in dist/
```

| Path | |
|---|---|
| `src/pages/index.astro` | Landing page |
| `src/content/docs/docs/` | Documentation, served under `/docs/` |
| `src/assets/shots/` | Screenshots of the pedalboard (2048 × 1200) |
| `public/media/` | Screen recordings (MP4 and WebM, with a poster) |
| `src/styles/` | Landing page and documentation themes |

Screenshots and recordings come from the x86_64 OS image running in QEMU. Captures shown in
them belong to their creators on TONE3000, who are credited in the captions.

The site is published at [openrig.eu](https://openrig.eu) by GitHub Pages on every push to
`main`. `SITE` and `BASE` set where it is served (`BASE=/openrig-site` to serve it under the
repository name instead of the custom domain).

## Analytics

Visits are counted with a self-hosted [Umami](https://umami.is) at `stats.siryu.me`, set up in
`src/analytics.mjs` and loaded on every page (landing layout and Starlight `head`). It sets no
cookies, only counts on `openrig.eu` (not local previews or github.io), and sends nothing when
the browser has Do Not Track or Global Privacy Control on, or after the opt-out on `/privacy`.
Query strings are stripped from URLs except `utm_*` tags. Web Vitals are sent too
(`data-performance`).

| Event | Properties | When |
|---|---|---|
| `get-started` | `location` | Hero "Get started" button |
| `download` | `location`, `version` / `page` | Link to the GitHub releases |
| `github` | `location`, `target` | Link to the OpenRig repository, its issues or changelog |
| `docs-link` | `location`, `target` | Landing page link into the docs |
| `outbound` | `host`, `url`, `page` | Any other link to another site |
| `edit-page` | `page` | "Edit page" link in the docs |
| `video-play` | `name`, `page` | First play of a docs recording |
| `copy-code` | `page` | Copy button of a code block |
| `search-open` | `page` | Docs search opened (the typed query is never sent) |
| `search-result` | `target` | Search result chosen: the page it leads to |

Links take a `data-umami-event` attribute where they are written in a component; links in the
Markdown, the search and code blocks are tracked by the inline script in `src/analytics.mjs`.
